## CIS3301-CODE-13-Merge-Sort-Recursion

## Instructions

In this CODE assignment you are asked to implement in Python the merge sort algorithm.

* Implement the recursie merge sort algorithm code in `get_merge_sorted_list`
* Your `get_merge_sorted_list` receives a unsorted list and returns a **sorted** list

Implement your code in code_13.py. To test your code, call your functions inside the if `__name__ == "__main__":` statement.

Your code will be tested using automated testing, but your final grade will be calculated by verifying if you implemented the algorithms correcty.

## Recursion
In programming, recursion is an algorithmic method in which a function calls itself to operate. Implementing recursion can speed up algorithms (e.g., search, sort, optimization) that otherwise will have to implement nested loops, which decreases the efficiency. Recursion is a popular method utilized in algorithms that follow the divide and conquer algorithmic paradigm.
